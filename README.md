Omniauth, Facebook and a Rails App
________

One of the things that I always struggled with was the Oauth/Omniauth log in to a Rails app. I found an old demo from 2011 on Tuts+ that I figured out how to work with Rails 4.2. This is that app

- Some things to take note of
  - gemfile
    - use ```gem 'omniauth'```
    - and ```gem 'omniauth-facebook'```
    - as well as ```gem 'figaro'``` for those secret keys


TODO
- actually do a blog post for this thing
